## Extra info
- This activity builds on everything we have learned so far... 
- some of the stuff I used to make this website is in the second lecture, don't worry about it yet.
- focus on the localStorage tasks I have above and it will make sense at the end of the Module 6
- [items.json](items.json) holds examples of store items, we learned about JSON in lecture its an important concept to become familiar with
